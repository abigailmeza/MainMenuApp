# Main Menu Application

## What is this project?
This project simulates the functions of the main-menu or start-up screen of a video-game. It allows users to create
new games, access saved games, and will later allow users to adjust video and audio settings.

## Interest Behind Project
Being an avid gamer my entire life, I've encountered all kinds of main title screens varying from 
minimalistic designs to ones who favoured interactivity and complexity. However, my personal favourite main menu screens
have always had two things in common: an **incredible graphical interface** and an **ease of navigation** between 
various players modes and game settings.
